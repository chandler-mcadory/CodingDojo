            The Dallas Cowboys
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Dallas Cowboys are America's team and, more imprtantly, God's team. The absence of a ring on Tony Romo's finger is a crime so heinous it brings tears to my eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite Cowboys players I got to watch play live are (in order):
            <ol>
                <li>Jason Witten</li>
                <li>Demarcus Ware</li>
                <li>Tony Romo</li>
                <li>Terrell Owens</li>
            </ol>
            Witten's hands were made of pure Elmer's, Ware could contain a grease fire with those tree trunks he calls arms, Romo was a scrambling fiend, and TO's routes were as tight as those jeans you've had since high school.

            D&D is a TTRPG. The goal of the game is to secretly convince children to worship the devil and practice occult magic.
